            A lifelong passion I have is music. I started studying piano as a kid, then growing up I experimented with
            different instruments:
            classical guitar, electric bass and drums. Only when I finally discovered and explored a little bit Johann
            Sebastian Bach's music
            I decided to dedicate myself to a deeper study of keyboard instruments.

            For five years I attended Istituto Civico Musicale "L. Rocca"
            in Alba where, under the teaching of M° Omar Caputi, I
            studied piano and pipe organ.
            Simultaneously I developed a taste for other keyboard instruments such as synthesizers, harpsichord and
            keyboards.
